Cocoa KeyValueObserving, Bindings and Notification
==================================================

This simple example shows how you can use 
[KeyValueObserving](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html), 
[Bindings](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaBindings/CocoaBindings.html)
and [Notification](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Notifications/Introduction/introNotifications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000043-SW1) 
in Objective-C.

Description
------------------
Each example can be seen on a separate branch. The master branch 
contains the basic project.

There will be a separate branch on using Bindings programmatically 
and through the Interface Builder.
